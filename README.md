Whispertext
===========

Whispertext (name possibly subject to change) is a *true* text-only Second-Life viewer.  Some others that claim to be text-only are indeed non-graphical, but when I hear "text-only" I expect something that will run in text mode, no graphic support needed, no fancy windows, *just text*.

Whispertext relies upon the Whisper library (http://sourceforge.net/projects/slxslchat/) by Thomas Pedley for actual connection to the server.  Whisper provides XML events for all the various happenings in-world; whispertext merely interprets and provides a slightly more readable and writable interface.

Right now it's very messy, with most stuff just splashed onto the screen raw and only a few commands supported.  But it's a start.
